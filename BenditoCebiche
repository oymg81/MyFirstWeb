  <p id="aboutWeek" class="navy"> This website is dedicated to Peruvian food and Bendito Cebiche.
    The impact of gastronomy on the Peruvian economy transcends the field of tourism, despite being intrinsically linked to this sector. The great variety of Peruvian gastronomy is based on three sources: the particularity of Peru's geography, the mix of cultures, and the adaptation of ancient cultures to modern cuisine. We inform you about the process of preparing meals, from how to obtain the raw materials to obtain the final product, which is the presentation of the dish.
